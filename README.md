# tigermatch
* CAS-authenticated Princeton dating app, full stack. 
* MVP: for Princeton students, using RDBMS filtering (by user-set preferences)

## Stretch goals: 
* weighted db-table filtering (major is not as important to me as settle_location, etc.)
* suggest matches (algo)

## Deployment:
* Heroku CLI
* Postgres for txt data, Cloudinary for images (embedded URL lines within Postgres)
